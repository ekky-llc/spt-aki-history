## What's Changed

G'day nerds, last update for a few months, not going to have access to a gaming rig for ~10 weeks, so unlikely you'll see this project get updates for a while.

Anyway here are the goodies:

- 🎯 Added ballistics/projectile tracking, now all ballistics and projectile paths are tracked and displayed in the replay mode.
- 🖼 UI Rework, with my future plans for a public hub, I reworked the UI so I could share interfaces and code between a public and private instance of the web client. Nothing too crazy, but it's much easier to navigate now, and adding features will also be easier.
- 📈 Added a charting library to the Web Interface, and calculated stats such as Active Bots, Kill Activity, Looting Activity, and Projectile Activity throughout a Raid. Should help all of you that use this mod for Spawn/AI Overhaul debugging.
- 📋 Implementation of a per raid so you can quickly see all the players/bots, including total kills, looting, and projectile accuracy.
- 🚰 Fixed memory leak for Loot Tracking, which also fixed compatibility with Realism Mod, so the the mask breathing issue is fixed now (sorry about that).
- 🐞 Various bug fixes, mostly one's found by Chazu related to the SAIN integration, thank you, you legend!
- 🔧 Configuration file changes for server side mod, now allows for the Raid Tracker timeout settings to be adjusted, should help people who pause the game for hours at a time (for all you dad gamers out there).

I will say that this will be the **FINAL** 3.8.X compatible update, all future updates will be for 3.9.X.

From the looks of things I'm one of the few last 3.8.X enjoyers, so I'll move onto 3.9.X when I return.
